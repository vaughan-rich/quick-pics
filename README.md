# Quick Pics. üîç üì∏

A basic script that downloads images from Google, based on a search term.

## Usage:

* Install [Selenium WebDriver for Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)
* Choose whether you want to go headless or not, and toggle the comment on line 14 accordingly.
* Run the Python code and type your search term in the Terminal window.
* The script will create a new directory, perform the search, and download the images. The number of images downloaded depends on the number of search results, but it should give you around 600+ images consistently, for use in ML training datasets etc.

## In Future Versions:
* Add the ability to download higher resolution images
* Add the ability to choose how many images you want to download
* Add some error handling / Selenium assertions to make things a bit more robust
